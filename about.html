<h1>About Death Metal Podcast for Kids</h1>


In the ancient days of darkness and fire-- before the oceans drank Atlantis; before the earth cracked and like,
lots of lava came up and totally made everything glow red and it was pretty hardcore; like at least a year ago--
two heroes were called upon to cover for their ailing uncle and host his public radio program:
Uncle Mathison's Family Radio Hour.  Those heroes, clad in the armor of Slayer and wielding the weapons of rock,
were the cousins: Kenneth and Drew Mathison. As they valiantly struggled to navigate the most un-metal like waters
of public radio they discovered that the radio station had evil plans to replace their uncle's show with a sports program!
In desperation, and aided by the masterful sound-man abilities of their new friend Femur, the two boys created Death Metal
Family Radio Hour, the most hardcore hour of radio that has ever happened. Like, dudes, we're not even kidding. It was hardcore.
Ultimately they failed to save their uncle's show, but at the eleventh hour, they picked up an awesome contract to do a
podcast for kids! And in shadowed corners throughout the land, where men dwell in fear under darkened skies,  people are
totally still whispering this story and wondering when... if ever... the heroes will return to totally rock out.
