      Kenneth and Drew are two death metal-crazed cousins whose podcast "Death Metal Podcast for Kids" is taking the world by storm. Led by segments like "Hardcore Nap Time" and "Hey, Let's Share the Demon Horns", their weekly show is exploding onto the emerging children's podcast scene. But as the two star to gain success, they must navigate the unfamiliar and most un-SLayer-like wateres of corporate America - and must decide whether the rewards of success are worth the creative price they're starting to pay.
